        <p>New special batch for students and job seekers

            We are starting new Python Language Programming Batch.

            The best advantage of this batch is I will give notes along with explanation of each concept in the class
            itself like classroom classes(offline classes) so that you will get complete notes with programs which is
            useful to attend University exams and interviews.

            We follow the content of major Universities so that you can write University exam very well..

            Please pass this information to all your friends, juniors, seniors and all available social media groups.
